EvopopRemix
====

Using Evopop theme as base with some tweaks:
* Yosemite-styled window buttons
* Android Lollipop-styled wingpanel

This project is still a work in progress.
Requires Gtk 3.16 & gtk-engine-murrine to function properly.

###Notice:
Since i had unfixable issues with the window controls support for 3.14 & unity is dropped.
However a version of the theme with normal window controls named [BasePop](https://github.com/poltertec/basepop-gtk-theme) can be used.

###Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file & run the included install script.

    sh autogen.sh
    sudo make install
